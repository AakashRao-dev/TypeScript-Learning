## What is TypeScript? üòó
- TypeScript is a free and open source strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript developed on (October 2012) and maintained by Microsoft.

- It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

- It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript (which means we gotta need to compile it down using a compiler to JavaScript).

## Pros of TypeScript ü§î
- **Strong typing**: TypeScript adds a type system to JavaScript, which can help catch errors before the code is run.

- **Improved code quality**: TypeScript's type system can make it easier to understand and maintain large codebases.

- **Better editor and tooling support**: Many popular code editors and IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in support for TypeScript, which can improve the development experience.

- **Easier to scale**: TypeScript's type system can help prevent bugs and make it easier to understand how to use different parts of a codebase, which can be especially helpful as a codebase grows in size and complexity.

- **Improved documentation**: The use of TypeScript can make it easier to understand what types of data a function or variable is expecting, which can make it easier to document and understand the code.

- **Better security**: TypeScript can help prevent certain types of security vulnerabilities by catching type-related errors before the code is deployed.

## Cons of TypeScript ü§®
- **Steep learning curve**: TypeScript has a steeper learning curve than plain JavaScript, especially for developers who are not familiar with a typed language.

- **Additional setup and configuration**: Setting up a TypeScript project can be more complex than setting up a plain JavaScript project, and configuring TypeScript to work with existing JavaScript code can also be challenging.

- **Increased build time**: TypeScript code needs to be transpiled to JavaScript, which can add additional build time to the development process.

- **Limited support**: TypeScript is not as widely supported as JavaScript, so it may be more difficult to find help or resources when encountering issues.

- **Not necessary for small projects**: TypeScript's type checking and other features may not be necessary for small projects, making it an unnecessary overhead.

- **Not compatible with all libraries**: Some libraries may not be written in TypeScript or may not have type definitions available, which can make it difficult to use them in a TypeScript project.
